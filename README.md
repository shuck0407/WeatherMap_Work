### Analysis
* Observed Trend 1:  Temperatures rise as you approach the equator for cities in both the northern and southern hemispheres.  We are approaching the September equinox (Sept. 22, 2018), which means that the earth's tilt is perpendicular to the sun, so neither the northern or southern hemisphere is tilted more toward the sun.  This means that maximum temperatures should be about equal between the cities in the northern and southern hemisphere, meaning one shouldn't be significantly warmer than the other.  The graph shows that this is true.
* Observed Trend 2:  Latitude does not have a strong relationship with humidity.  However, it is interesting to note that the majority of our cities had humidity levels between 60 and 100%, which is pretty humid in my book. It looks like the planet is more humid than dry, but more analysis would have to be done on this.
* Observed Trend 3:  I plotted the relationship between humidity and temperature because I would assume humidity would be the worst in the hottest climates.  This, however, did not turn out to be true.  Cities with maximum temperatures between 50 and 80 degrees had the worst humidity.  Cities above 80 degrees started trending towards less humidity (drier air).   
* Observed Trend 4:  There is no strong relationship between latitude and cloudiness. It is interesting that a lot of our cities fell on the zero cloudiness line (nice, clear days!), but in contrast and a lot fell between 75 and 90%.  Something else must be affecting cloudiness.
* Observed Trend 5:  There is no strong corelation between latitude and wind speed. So, I also plotted temperature vs. wind speed to see if there was any clear relationship there.  There was none.  At the moment I pulled my data, a lot of cities weren't having very much wind, so it could just be a timing factor.
